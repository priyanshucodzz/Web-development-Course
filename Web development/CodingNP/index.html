            <p>The introduction should talk more about the topic under concern in the article. If the introduction is
                lengthy and boring, the readers will bail out from reading and shift to another piece of writing.
                The main body should contain 2 to 5 paragraphs, which further discuss the topic and explain the idea.
                Again, a lengthy and boring body would distract the reader’s attention and discourage them from further
                reading. Hence, articles should be tailored to suit the target audience’s taste. For example, if it is
                meant for 5th-grade students, then you should use simple terms. On the contrary, if it is meant for
                doctors, it should contain a language that makes your readers feel at home.</p>
